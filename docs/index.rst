Welcome to ChopShop's documentation!
====================================

ChopShop is a framework for analyzing and decoding network traffic.  Based on
libnids/pynids, it can be used for standard network protocols (like HTTP and
DNS), or for malware command and control protocols used by malware families
like Poison Ivy and Gh0st RAT.

ChopShop is developed by the MITRE Corporation with contributions from several
other organizations.
