chopweb - HTTP interface to ChopShop
====================================

The ``chopweb`` program is a Python script that starts a web server, allowing
users to interact with ChopShop through a web browser. It requires Python 2.6+,
mod\_pywebsocket, and pynids.

The chopweb program is currently in an alpha state; more documentation will be
added once a stable version is released.
